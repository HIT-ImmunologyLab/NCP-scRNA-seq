## Ligand-receptor paris database
A draft network of ligand–receptor-mediated multicellular signalling in human
- Present the first large-scale map of cell-to-cell communication between 144 human primary cell types. 
- Reveal that most cells express tens to hundreds of ligands and receptors to create a highly connected signalling network through multiple ligand–receptor paths
- Provide an online tool to interactively query and visualize our networks (https://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/suppl/Ramilowski_et_al_2015/)

- Demonstrate how this tool can reveal novel cell-to-cell interactions with the prediction that mast cells signal to monoblastic lineages via the CSF1–CSF1R interacting pair.
