## Introduction
The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database provides a specialist database for sequences of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and includes the official sequences named by the [WHO Nomenclature Committee For Factors of the HLA System](http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/committee.html). The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database is part of the international [ImMunoGeneTics project](http://www.imgt.org/) (IMGT).

The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database currently contains **25,958 allele sequences** . In addition to the **physical sequences**, the database contains **detailed information concerning the material from which the sequences were derived, as well as data on the validation of the sequences**. It is now standard procedure for authors to submit the sequences directly to the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database for curation and assignment of an official name prior to publication - this avoids the problems associated with renaming published sequences and the confusion of multiple names for the same sequence. 

The database uses the [2010 naming convention for HLA alleles](http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/naming.html) in all tools herein. To aid in the adoption of the new nomenclature, all search tools can be used with both the current and pre-2010 allele designations. The [pre-2010 nomenclature designations](http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/naming_prev.html) are only used where older reports or outputs have been made available for download.

## Accessing the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database
The IPD-IMGT/HLA Database can be accessed a variety of ways. You can query the database using the a number of access methods from the following tables.

Query Tools

Tools Name | Tools Description
