## Description
Table 1. SARS-CoV-derived T-cell epitopes and their conservation in human coronaviruses. aThe position information is based on the SARS-CoV (strain TJF; GenBank accession no. AY654624) bThe sequences of the corresponding peptides in SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 (strain HK04-01; GenBank accession no. JN129834), and HKU1 (strain BJ01-p3; GenBank accession no. KT779555). The variable residues in the peptides compared to MERS-CoV are underlined in bold. cThe references that identified the peptides. dThe references that used the peptides as vaccines or used the peptides to evaluate SARS-related vaccines. eThe positions of HLA-restricted peptides with three or less variable residues between MERS-CoV and any of the three coronaviruses SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 are shown in bold.
